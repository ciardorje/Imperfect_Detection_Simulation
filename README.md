# Imperfect_Detection_Simulation
Framework for simulating realistic fragmented communities and associated, incomplete sampling procedures. A series of diversity estimators are then applied to the generated data and estimator performance is  assessed in terms of accuracy, bias, coverage probability and precision (with reference to the true community metric values).
